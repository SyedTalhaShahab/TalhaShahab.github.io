    <b> Alan Turing </b>
<p>Alan Turing is an influential person in computer science. Alan Turing’s date of birth is June 23, 1912. Alan Turing
    died on June 7,1954. That is because he created the Turing machine. He created a debate between mathematicians that
    said if it was possible to create a powerful machine that could somehow allow humans to somehow find solutions to
    all types of mathematical problems. </p>
<b>For example, most computer scientists in the computer science industry consider him the father of computer science.
</b>
<p>Most computer scientists consider him famous for creating his work for modern computers. He created the touring test.
    The touring test would be famous later for making artificial intelligence possible in the twenty-first century. </p>
<b>Alan Turing created the first Turing machine from 1936 to 1937. That machine is not detailed equipment, instead, it
    is a theoretical gadget that attempted to help mathematicians understand the power of computations. Alan Turing’s
    machines were called automatic in 1936 because they were used for calculations of real numbers. Alan Turing built
    computer machines that allowed the USA to decipher the Enigma code. </b>
<p>Alan Turing’s success in cracking the code was not heard or seen until a long time after it was done. </p>
<i>Alan Turing accidentally suffocated himself with cyanide gas at forty-one years. However, the intentions are not
    known how or why the accident happened. </i>
<p>Alan Turing created the Turing Machine, and that machine could calculate computable numbers in math. </p>
<i>Alan Turing’s first machine was instructions that were on tape paper. That machine Alan Turing created is still used
    in the twenty-first century as a representation of a mathematical computer. </i>
